Ok now the wss endpoint is made and can be stats tracked in the UI - It can be used
in the mad lab as an endpoint for you personally! Just add it to the wss endpoints in index.html
This will allow you to select it when the page is loaded - now you are 100% on your own code+node.

Copy the wss box, add it to madlab - super simple!

Consider upgrading, or supporting the main node the mad lab runs via a donation in the send tx section.

Good luck out there mad lads! - ClassyXoge



inside index.html find :

If at any time servers are not working you can replace them/remove them and continue on.
Random server is selected at start by default mad lab code.
You can remove all servers other than yours and it will use yours only!
The addresses for the ripple servers can be found online easily
The default mad lab comes with all of this as well as mad labs own wss servers.
