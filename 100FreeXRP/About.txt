This wallet contains 100 XRP.
Whoever gets into it can have it, that is the reward.
The basic encryption of mad lab is what protects it.

If it can be easily broken, it should be know.
If not then it shall stand the test of time.

I built mad lab on $0 by myself, I did my best,
but the best is not always good enough - so we should
always be able to check and see if it is good enough.
