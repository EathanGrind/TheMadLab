The Mad Lab is a free XRPL wallet and AMM - Designed to be ran in a clean environment via -

A VM, A portapps install to USB device, On a clean computer, On a clean Browser.
Running mad lab code can have risks if not hosting it yourself from the raw files.

To run mad lab - simply download the entire package, place on your device where you
want to run it from. After that click the index.html and it should open the website
inside your default browser. 

This is not optimal and you should take that URL/File path shown in the normal http bar
and paste that into a new/freshly installed browser. This will be a lot more secure for
regular use, dedicate a browser install for the mad lab to reduce risk further if you can
not do a VM/Pi/Portapp or anything else setup.

You may edit the files and change it, all of the code is there. There is also an optional
donation link in the send transaction section for those inclined to.

Features - 
Standard wallet control + Amm trading/ Liquidity pool management.

Security -
Argon2 Outer shell, random salt, random ciphers. 12+ string recommended for passwords.
Argon2 is the gold standard in encryption and is vastly under-used. Over a decade strong, 
still considered the best there is and having won many awards.

Under the outer shell is two AES-GCM encryption layers. These further harden the encryption
and security. 

Memory protection is Argon2, shifting, RK/RS. Triple overwrite and shifting per action.

Network - 
Wss secure server connections used, keys not sent over/signed tx's locally then sent blobs.

Hackable? Sure - always someone more geeky who can do anything. Practical? Nah - not really.
If you are using it in clean spaces - probably never an issue.

100 XRP wallet holding account for free with download. Have fun mad lads :)
